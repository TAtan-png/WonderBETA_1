        <p class="content">this website, the <strong>wondertrips &copy;2025</strong> website was made by a little group of students of <em>9th grade</em>, every member had a specific task, we wanted this project to be an oportunity for use, so if we put on enough effort we would have not only the points of the activity but also people interested on our work, however <em>this is not a professional work</em> it is just a schoolar project, so if you have found problems or bugs, remember that we are teenagerers, so whether you want to contact with us or give feedback, comments, or if you want <strong>wondertrips &copy;2025</strong> to be a real website, we are open to every type of advise or offers</p>
